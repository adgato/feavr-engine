Entity Components:

Destroy method is called when the component is removed from the entity during RefreshComponents.
Serialize handles saving and loading the Component.
Within Serialize, each field is expected to be serialized using m->SerializeVar, m->SerializeCmp, m->SerializeArr.
These serialize in the following format [tag][size][data]. Where size == sizeof(data).
Tags are used to handle the case when component class fields are renamed, added or removed - they are expected to be constants that are strictly increasing through the Serialize method.
This is so that when loading, the serializer skips over any tags smaller than the next field, and only loads in the field if it finds a matching tag to load from.
If the size of a primitive (int, char, etc.) or primitive array field differs from the size saved, it is not loaded.

The names of the components used by the entity components system are decided at compile time. When saving they are included as a comma seperated list at the beginning of the file.
This is so that if components are reordered, added or removed - the serializer can still recover data from the file.
If components are renamed, their entry in the saved file will also need to be manually renamed.
When loading the entity component system, any fields of components that are not serialized are default constructed.
